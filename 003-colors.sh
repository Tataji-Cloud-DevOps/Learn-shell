# Syntax to print colors

#### How can we add a backGround color ? Here is the syntax 
# echo -e "\e[43;31m I am printing Text with a backGround Color \e[0m"

echo -e "\e[46;31m I am printing Text with a backGround color \e[0m"

echo -e "\e[44;31m GOLLAKOTI \e[0m"


# Since in bash and shell, there are lot of versions, both of the syntaxes are valid, in case if anyone doesn't work, prefer to use the other one.
# echo $a 
# echo ${a}
