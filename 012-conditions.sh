if condition is ideally available in 3 formats :
    1) Simple If 
    2) If Else 
    3) Else If  

# syntax

1) Simple If :  

    if [ expression ]; then
            commands
    fi 

    Commands are going to be executed only if the expression is true. 

* What will happen if the expression  or false  ? Simple, commands won't be executed.
